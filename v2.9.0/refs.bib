abstract = {This paper presents an online portfolio selection algorithm based on pattern matching principle where it makes a decision on the optimal portfolio in each period and updates the optimal portfolio at the beginning of each period. The proposed method consists of two steps: i) sample selection, ii) portfolio optimization. First, in the sample selection, clustering algorithms including k-means, k-medoids, spectral and hierarchical clustering are applied to discover time windows (TW) similar to the recent time window. Then, after finding the similar time windows and predicting the market behavior of the next day, the optimum function along with the transaction cost is used in the portfolio optimization step in which, four algorithms including KMNLOG, KMDLOG, SPCLOG and HRCLOG are proposed for this purpose. The presented algorithms are applied on 5 different datasets with different characteristics including different markets, stocks, and time periods, and their performance has been evaluated. The results show that the provided algorithms in this paper, have better performance in terms of efficiency compared to the algorithms provided in the literature.}

Our strategy, named combination weights based on online gradient descent (CW-OGD), achieves improved robustness by integrating different expert strategies and overcomes the difficult problem of complex computational time. First, an expert system including many basic expert strategies, in which we choose the strategy that invests in a single stock as the basic expert strategy, is established. Second, we exploit the loss function to evaluate the performance of different basic expert strategies and use the OGD algorithm to update the weight vector for the experts based on their losses. In addition, we theoretically prove that the proposed strategy has a regret bound. Finally, extensive experiments conducted on four stock combinations and seven benchmark datasets show that our strategy can outperform some state-of-the-art strategies in terms of the return, risk and computational time metrics. Furthermore, our strategy can achieve higher returns even at certain transaction cost rates, which illustrates its effectiveness in the actual stock market.}

abstract="Online Portfolio Selection is regarded as a fundamental problem in Computational Finance. Pattern-Matching methods, and the CORN-K algorithm in particular, have provided promising results. Despite making notable progress, there exists a gap in the current state of the art -- systematic risk is not considered. The lack of attention to systematic risk could lead to poor investment returns, especially in volatile markets. In response to this, we extend the CORN-K algorithm to present DRICORN-K -- a Dynamic RIsk CORrelation-driven Non-parametric algorithm. DRICORN-K continuously adjusts a portfolio's market sensitivity based on the current market conditions. We measure market sensitivity using the {\$}{\$}{\backslash}beta {\$}{\$}$\beta$measure. DRICORN-K aims to take advantage of upward market trends and protect portfolios against downward market trends. To this end, we implement a number of market classification methods. We find that an exponentially weighted moving linear regression method provides the best classification of current market conditions. We further conducted an empirical analysis on five real world stock indices: the JSE Top 40, Bovespa, DAX, DJIA and Nikkei 225 against twelve state of the art algorithms. The results show that DRICORN-K can deliver improved performance over the current state of the art, as measured by cumulative return, Sharpe ratio and maximum drawdown. The experimental results lead us to conclude that the addition of dynamic systematic risk adjustments to CORN-K can result in improved portfolio performance.",

Most existing state-of-the-art systems, however, rely on the defensive strategies, which lack adaptivity to some extent and may lose investment opportunities in the real financial market. In this paper, we propose a novel local adaptive learning model which seamlessly integrates both defensive and aggressive strategies to enhance the adaptivity and profitability of the whole portfolio system. Different from some popular portfolio selection systems that assume a predefined price tendency, we set up an evaluation function to predict the tendency and activate the corresponding selection strategies. The total capital is allocated according to the value expectations of different assets. Through taking the bests of the complementary strategies, it can make a good balance between wealth returns and risks. In addition, our system is capable of dealing with financial data in linear time, which is suitable for real-time trading applications. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that our model outperforms some state-of-the-art ones both in effectiveness and efficiency.}

abstract = {In this paper, we propose an effective online portfolio selection strategy by integrating expert opinions, which are obtained based on mean reversion and trading volume. Existing studies have found that mean reversion and high volume premium exist in the stock market in the short term. Some online portfolio strategies have been proposed that rely upon mean reversion, but it is rare to consider both mean reversion and high volume premium, which is what we will do in this paper. First, a portfolio based on mean reversion and high volume premium is constructed using recent window data. Second, a pool of portfolios, also known as a pool of expert strategies or expert opinions, is established by changing the window size. Finally, the online gradient update algorithm is adopted to integrate a pool of expert strategies, and the MRvol strategy in this paper is proposed. Theoretically, we prove that the regret of MRvol is bounded. Empirically, we use the actual stock price and trading volume data from different markets to test the performance of MRvol. The results show that MRvol performs better than other online strategies in terms of final cumulative wealth and risk-adjusted return metrics in most cases, among which the annualized percentage yield on all datasets is 16%–37%, and the average values of Sharpe ratio, Calmar ratio and Information ratio are 1.113, 0.9216 and 0.0299, respectively. Additionally, MRvol has linear computational time complexity, and the running time of test results is all less than 1 s. Furthermore, it maintains strong robustness under different parameters and can bear reasonable transaction costs.}

abstract = {On-line portfolio selection, a fundamental problem in computational finance, has attracted increasing interest from artificial intelligence and machine learning communities in recent years. Empirical evidence shows that stock's high and low prices are temporary and stock prices are likely to follow the mean reversion phenomenon. While existing mean reversion strategies are shown to achieve good empirical performance on many real datasets, they often make the single-period mean reversion assumption, which is not always satisfied, leading to poor performance in certain real datasets. To overcome this limitation, this article proposes a multiple-period mean reversion, or so-called “Moving Average Reversion” (MAR), and a new on-line portfolio selection strategy named “On-Line Moving Average Reversion” (OLMAR), which exploits MAR via efficient and scalable online machine learning techniques. From our empirical results on real markets, we found that OLMAR can overcome the drawbacks of existing mean reversion algorithms and achieve significantly better results, especially on the datasets where existing mean reversion algorithms failed. In addition to its superior empirical performance, OLMAR also runs extremely fast, further supporting its practical applicability to a wide range of applications. Finally, we have made all the datasets and source codes of this work publicly available at our project website: http://OLPS.stevenhoi.org/.}

abstract = "This article proposes a novel online portfolio selection strategy named ``Passive Aggressive Mean Reversion'' (PAMR). Unlike traditional trend following approaches, the proposed approach relies upon the mean reversion relation of financial markets. Equipped with online passive aggressive learning technique from machine learning, the proposed portfolio selection strategy can effectively exploit the mean reversion property of markets. By analyzing PAMR's update scheme, we find that it nicely trades off between portfolio return and volatility risk and reflects the mean reversion trading principle. We also present several variants of PAMR algorithm, including a mixture algorithm which mixes PAMR and other strategies. We conduct extensive numerical experiments to evaluate the empirical performance of the proposed algorithms on various real datasets. The encouraging results show that in  most cases the proposed PAMR strategy outperforms all benchmarks and almost all state-of-the-art portfolio selection strategies under various performance metrics. In addition to its superior performance, the proposed PAMR runs extremely fast and thus is very suitable for real-life online trading applications.

abstract = {Online portfolio selection is a fundamental research problem, which has drawn extensive investigations in both machine learning and computational finance communities. The evolution of electronic trading has contributed to the growing prevalence of High-Frequency Trading (HFT) in recent years. Generally, HFT requires trading strategies to be fast in execution. However, the existing online portfolio selection strategies fail to either satisfy the demand for high execution speed or make effective utilization of historical data. In response, we propose a framework named Exponential Gradient with Momentum (EGM) which integrates EG with an acknowledged optimization method in stochastic learning, i.e., momentum. Specifically, momentum boosts the performance of EG by making full use of historical information. Most essentially, EGM can execute with only constant memory and running time in the number of assets per trading period, thus overcoming the drawback of most online strategies. The theoretical analysis reveals that EGM bounds the regret sublinearly. The extensive experiments conducted on four real-world datasets demonstrate that EGM outperforms relevant strategies with respect to comprehensive evaluation metrics.}

First of all, because of the influence of stock price anomaly, TPPT strategy sets adjustable historical window width. It uses slope value to judge prediction direction to track price change, which uses exponential moving average and peak equal weight slope value three-state price prediction method. Secondly, the accumulated wealth target is refined, and the fast error Back Propagation based on gradient projection algorithm (BP) is added. The algorithm solves investment proportion and feedbacks the increasing ability of assets to the investment proportion in order to maximize the accumulated wealth.

abstract = {We experimentally study on-line investment algorithms first proposed by Agarwal and Hazan and extended by Hazan et al. which achieve almost the same wealth as the best constant-rebalanced portfolio determined in hindsight. These algorithms are the first to combine optimal logarithmic regret bounds with efficient deterministic computability. They are based on the Newton method for offline optimization which, unlike previous approaches, exploits second order information. After analyzing the algorithm using the potential function introduced by Agarwal and Hazan, we present extensive experiments on actual financial data. These experiments confirm the theoretical advantage of our algorithms, which yield higher returns and run considerably faster than previous algorithms with optimal regret. Additionally, we perform financial analysis using mean-variance calculations and the Sharpe ratio.},

abstract = {Online portfolio selection is a practical problem in financial engineering and quantitative trading. Many empirical studies show that stock performance in the market is likely to follow mean reversion, and strategies based on mean reversion show better return performance than the market average. However, the existing mean reversion strategies are not universal and short selling is not allowed, which is unsuitable for real-time investment. In this paper, we propose a distributed mean reversion online portfolio strategy through a stock correlation sub-network to solve these problems. Theoretical analysis shows that our strategy is universal and the convergence rate is calculated. The empirical results show that our strategy is better than the existing universal strategies in terms of return performance, nor is it sensitive to transaction cost.}
