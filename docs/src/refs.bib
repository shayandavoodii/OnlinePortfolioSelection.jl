abstract = {This paper presents an online portfolio selection algorithm based on pattern matching principle where it makes a decision on the optimal portfolio in each period and updates the optimal portfolio at the beginning of each period. The proposed method consists of two steps: i) sample selection, ii) portfolio optimization. First, in the sample selection, clustering algorithms including k-means, k-medoids, spectral and hierarchical clustering are applied to discover time windows (TW) similar to the recent time window. Then, after finding the similar time windows and predicting the market behavior of the next day, the optimum function along with the transaction cost is used in the portfolio optimization step in which, four algorithms including KMNLOG, KMDLOG, SPCLOG and HRCLOG are proposed for this purpose. The presented algorithms are applied on 5 different datasets with different characteristics including different markets, stocks, and time periods, and their performance has been evaluated. The results show that the provided algorithms in this paper, have better performance in terms of efficiency compared to the algorithms provided in the literature.}

We evaluate the empirical performance of our algorithm extensively on several large historical and latest real stock markets, and show that it can easily beat both the market index and the best stock in the market substantially (without or with small transaction costs), and also surpass a variety of state-of-the-art techniques significantly.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a new online portfolio selection strategy based on a weighted learning technique and an online gradient descent algorithm. Our strategy, named combination weights based on online gradient descent (CW-OGD), achieves improved robustness by integrating different expert strategies and overcomes the difficult problem of complex computational time. First, an expert system including many basic expert strategies, in which we choose the strategy that invests in a single stock as the basic expert strategy, is established. Second, we exploit the loss function to evaluate the performance of different basic expert strategies and use the OGD algorithm to update the weight vector for the experts based on their losses. In addition, we theoretically prove that the proposed strategy has a regret bound. Finally, extensive experiments conducted on four stock combinations and seven benchmark datasets show that our strategy can outperform some state-of-the-art strategies in terms of the return, risk and computational time metrics. Furthermore, our strategy can achieve higher returns even at certain transaction cost rates, which illustrates its effectiveness in the actual stock market.}

abstract="Online Portfolio Selection is regarded as a fundamental problem in Computational Finance. Pattern-Matching methods, and the CORN-K algorithm in particular, have provided promising results. Despite making notable progress, there exists a gap in the current state of the art -- systematic risk is not considered. The lack of attention to systematic risk could lead to poor investment returns, especially in volatile markets. In response to this, we extend the CORN-K algorithm to present DRICORN-K -- a Dynamic RIsk CORrelation-driven Non-parametric algorithm. DRICORN-K continuously adjusts a portfolio's market sensitivity based on the current market conditions. We measure market sensitivity using the {\$}{\$}{\backslash}beta {\$}{\$}$\beta$measure. DRICORN-K aims to take advantage of upward market trends and protect portfolios against downward market trends. To this end, we implement a number of market classification methods. We find that an exponentially weighted moving linear regression method provides the best classification of current market conditions. We further conducted an empirical analysis on five real world stock indices: the JSE Top 40, Bovespa, DAX, DJIA and Nikkei 225 against twelve state of the art algorithms. The results show that DRICORN-K can deliver improved performance over the current state of the art, as measured by cumulative return, Sharpe ratio and maximum drawdown. The experimental results lead us to conclude that the addition of dynamic systematic risk adjustments to CORN-K can result in improved portfolio performance.",

The algorithm employs a multiplicative update rule derived using a framework introduced by Kivinen and Warmuth. Our algorithm is very simple to implement and requires only constant storage and computing time per stock in each trading period. We tested the performance of our algorithm on real stock data from the New York Stock Exchange accumulated during a 22-year period. On these data, our algorithm clearly outperforms the best single stock as well as Cover's universal portfolio selection algorithm. We also present results for the situation in which the investor has access to additional “side information.”},

abstract = {Online portfolio selection is an important problem in financial trading which has attracted increasing interests from the machine learning and data mining community. Most existing state-of-the-art systems, however, rely on the defensive strategies, which lack adaptivity to some extent and may lose investment opportunities in the real financial market. In this paper, we propose a novel local adaptive learning model which seamlessly integrates both defensive and aggressive strategies to enhance the adaptivity and profitability of the whole portfolio system. Different from some popular portfolio selection systems that assume a predefined price tendency, we set up an evaluation function to predict the tendency and activate the corresponding selection strategies. The total capital is allocated according to the value expectations of different assets. Through taking the bests of the complementary strategies, it can make a good balance between wealth returns and risks. In addition, our system is capable of dealing with financial data in linear time, which is suitable for real-time trading applications. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that our model outperforms some state-of-the-art ones both in effectiveness and efficiency.}

abstract = {In this paper, we propose an effective online portfolio selection strategy by integrating expert opinions, which are obtained based on mean reversion and trading volume. Existing studies have found that mean reversion and high volume premium exist in the stock market in the short term. Some online portfolio strategies have been proposed that rely upon mean reversion, but it is rare to consider both mean reversion and high volume premium, which is what we will do in this paper. First, a portfolio based on mean reversion and high volume premium is constructed using recent window data. Second, a pool of portfolios, also known as a pool of expert strategies or expert opinions, is established by changing the window size. Finally, the online gradient update algorithm is adopted to integrate a pool of expert strategies, and the MRvol strategy in this paper is proposed. Theoretically, we prove that the regret of MRvol is bounded. Empirically, we use the actual stock price and trading volume data from different markets to test the performance of MRvol. The results show that MRvol performs better than other online strategies in terms of final cumulative wealth and risk-adjusted return metrics in most cases, among which the annualized percentage yield on all datasets is 16%–37%, and the average values of Sharpe ratio, Calmar ratio and Information ratio are 1.113, 0.9216 and 0.0299, respectively. Additionally, MRvol has linear computational time complexity, and the running time of test results is all less than 1 s. Furthermore, it maintains strong robustness under different parameters and can bear reasonable transaction costs.}

abstract = "This article proposes a novel online portfolio selection strategy named ``Passive Aggressive Mean Reversion'' (PAMR). Unlike traditional trend following approaches, the proposed approach relies upon the mean reversion relation of financial markets. Equipped with online passive aggressive learning technique from machine learning, the proposed portfolio selection strategy can effectively exploit the mean reversion property of markets. By analyzing PAMR's update scheme, we find that it nicely trades off between portfolio return and volatility risk and reflects the mean reversion trading principle. We also present several variants of PAMR algorithm, including a mixture algorithm which mixes PAMR and other strategies. We conduct extensive numerical experiments to evaluate the empirical performance of the proposed algorithms on various real datasets. The encouraging results show that in  most cases the proposed PAMR strategy outperforms all benchmarks and almost all state-of-the-art portfolio selection strategies under various performance metrics. In addition to its superior performance, the proposed PAMR runs extremely fast and thus is very suitable for real-life online trading applications. The experimental testbed including source codes and data sets is available at http://www.cais.ntu.edu.sg/~chhoi/PAMR/.",
